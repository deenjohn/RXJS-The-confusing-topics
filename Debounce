Discard emitted values that take less than the specified time, based on selector function, between output.

signature: debounce(durationSelector: function): Observable



const interval = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
//raise the debounce time by 200ms each second
const debouncedInterval = interval.debounce(
                                 val => Rx.Observable.timer(val * 200))
                                 
/*
  After 5 seconds, debounce time will be greater than interval time,
  all future values will be thrown away
  output: 0...1...2...3...4......(debounce time over 1s, no values emitted)
*/
const subscribe = debouncedInterval.subscribe(val => console.log(`Example Two: ${val}`));
